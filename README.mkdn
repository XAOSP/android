Getting started
---------------

To get started with Android/XAOSP, you'll need to get familiar with [Source Control Tools](https://source.android.com/setup/develop).

To initialize your local repository using the XAOSP trees, use a command like this:
```
repo init -u https://github.com/XAOSP/android.git -b 14 --git-lfs
```
Then to sync up:
```
repo sync
```


Build
```
source build/envsetup.sh
```
```
Breakfast device_codename
```
```
mka x
```
